🧠 Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship

Welcome to my collection of cybersecurity projects completed during the Prodigy InfoTech Internship. 
Each task focuses on applying core cybersecurity concepts using Python from classical encryption to network analysis.

🚀 Projects
🔐 Task 01 — Caesar Cipher

A Python-based encryption and decryption tool that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
It features a simple Tkinter GUI where users can input text and shift values to encrypt or decrypt messages.
Skills: Classical Cryptography, Python, GUI Design

🧩 Task 02 — Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation

Encrypts and decrypts images by modifying pixel values — showcasing a form of basic image-level encryption.
It’s an interesting blend of steganography-inspired logic and Python imaging techniques.
Skills: Image Processing, Python, Cryptography

🔑 Task 03 — Password Strength Checker

Evaluates password strength using regular expressions to check for character variety, length, and patterns.
Built with a clean Tkinter interface, this tool helps users learn the basics of password security.
Skills: Regex, Python, GUI, Cybersecurity

🌐  Task 04 — Network Packet Analyzer

A simple packet analyzer built using Scapy that captures and displays real-time network traffic.
This tool offers a practical introduction to network protocols and packet inspection.
Skills: Networking, Scapy, Python

🛠️  Tech Stack
Language: Python 
Libraries Used: Tkinter, PIL, Scapy, Regex, String
Domains Covered: Cryptography, Image Security, Password Analysis, Network Monitoring
