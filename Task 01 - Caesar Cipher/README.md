🔐 Task 01 — Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool
🧠 Overview

This project is a Python-based graphical encryption and decryption tool built using the Caesar Cipher algorithm — one of the most famous classical cryptographic techniques.
The program allows users to input text and a custom shift value to encrypt or decrypt instantly through an elegant Tkinter GUI.

It’s designed as part of my Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship, showcasing fundamental cryptography concepts and Python GUI development.

✨ Features

🔒 Encrypt & Decrypt any message using a shift-based Caesar Cipher.

🎨 Modern Tkinter GUI with a dark-themed interface.

📋 Copy Result button for easy clipboard access.

⚡ Real-time processing — results update instantly.

🧹 Clear button to reset inputs quickly.
