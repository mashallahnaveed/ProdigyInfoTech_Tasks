🔐 Task 03 — Password Strength Checker

Description:
A GUI-based Python tool that evaluates the strength of passwords in real-time based on character composition and length.
This project helps users understand how secure their passwords are, and demonstrates the use of regular expressions and GUI design to build practical cybersecurity applications.

Key Features:

🧩 Real-Time Strength Analysis: Instantly categorizes passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong.

🔍 Regex-Powered Validation: Checks for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

🧠 Interactive Tkinter Interface: Simple, dark-themed design with input box and color-coded feedback.

👁️ Password Toggle: Show or hide password input with a single click.

🧼 Clear Button: Reset input fields easily to test multiple passwords.

💡 Built-in Security Tips: Provides live suggestions for improving password strength.

How It Works:

User enters a password in the input field.

The program uses regular expressions (regex) to detect character variety.

Based on length and character mix, it assigns a strength level:

Weak → Too short or lacks diversity.

Medium → Decent mix, needs improvement.

Strong → Includes upper, lower, digits, and symbols.

A message box displays feedback and tips for enhancement.
